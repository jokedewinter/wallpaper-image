		<h1>An image as wallpaper</h1>

		<p>My work explores the relationship between the tyranny of ageing and daytime TV.</p>
		<p>With influences as diverse as Kierkegaard and Andy Warhol, new insights are crafted from both explicit and implicit textures.</p>
		<p>Ever since I was a postgraduate I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of the zeitgeist. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes debased into a dialectic of defeat, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the prospect of a new order.</p>
		<p>As shifting derivatives become clarified through studious and repetitive practice, the viewer is left with an insight into the edges of our condition.</p>
